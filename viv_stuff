- **Preprocessing the Data**
- IMDb Score:
- - label the score itself (high / medium / low) note this is likely to be based on percentiles rather than an arbirtrary 3/10 etc. Quick look at the data suggests bottom 30% have scores up to 6/10 so we might find the bad is upto 6, medium is 6-7 and high is above 7. 

**Preprocessing & Visualisation for Country**

## Preprocessing ##
-Create new book
-Add column for Country Adj

## Pass 1 ##
-Categories (UK, United States, Other)
-Removed lines 6 & 281 as they appeared spurious

## NOTES ##
-Country is not necessarily the measure we think it is - lots of films in other languages (177) for instance
