## Preprocessing & Visualisation for Country

## Preprocessing
-country_adj
-dominant_lang

## Pass 1
-Categories (UK, United States, Other) in to country_adj
-Removed country

## Pass 2
-Categories (English, Spanish, Other) in to dominant_lang

## Now what? - as of 20th March
-E-mailed team as not sure how to proceed - need a stripped down data set to make meaningful visualisations? 

## NOTES
-Country is not necessarily the measure we think it is - lots of films in other languages (177) for instance
-As a poss response did pre-processing for dominant language (dominant_lang)
-Mac .csv can't be read in pandas - save as microsoft .csv
