# Preprocessing looking at genre, and at ImdB score

- Step 1: Seperating out the categories in one column separated by | and counting
- Step 2: Creating csv files:      
  1. For each movie, list all genres (yes/no for each genre) and Imdb score     
  2. For each genre, list all scores for movies in that genre (vary variable length of rows)         
   
- Step 3: Do some visualisations with matplotlib (still to do!)
