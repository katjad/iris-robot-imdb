Pre-processing data for looking at Facebook likes:
 - Had to delete a lot (~2k!) entries with 0 likes
 - Sorted by facebook likes and ranked - found 25%/75% rank with which to assign low/medium/high labels

Data visualisation
 - Managed to plot gross against likes labelled and colour coded with high/medium/low (line In[18] of notebook) but this took quite 
 some messing around with googling stuff on using pandas
- Went to tutorial on predicting movie score and saw use of correlation matrix on quantitative data only - can calculate this easily
using df.corr(). Used seaborn heatmap plot - possible correlations with num_cfritic, actor3_facebook, gross, num_voted, cast_total,
num_user, actor2_facebook, imdb_score. Question remains on how to do qualitative data? Example cose here:

- NB had an issue of not seeing plots inside jupyter, this was due to needing comman 'matlib plot inline'
- Saving seaborn plots from within Jupyter - tried various methods of savefig but didn't seem to be working, actually looks like command
was just taking a long time to process so shutdown and re-opened notebook. This worked although output figure isn't great.
