Pre-processing data for looking at Facebook likes:
 - Had to delete a lot (~2k!) entries with 0 likes
 - Sorted by facebook likes and ranked - found 25%/75% rank with which to assign low/medium/high labels

Data visualisation
 - Managed to plot gross against likes labelled and colour coded with high/medium/low (line In[18] of notebook) but this took quite some messing around with googling stuff on using pandas
