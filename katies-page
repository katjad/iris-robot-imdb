Pre-processing data for looking at Facebook likes:
 - Had to delete a lot (~2k!) entries with 0 likes
 - Sorted by facebook likes and ranked - found 25%/75% rank with which to assign low/medium/high labels

Data visualisation
 - Managed to plot gross against likes labelled and colour coded with high/medium/low (line In[18] of notebook) but this took quite 
 some messing around with googling stuff on using pandas
- Went to tutorial on predicting movie score and saw use of correlation matrix on quantitative data only - can calculate this easily
using df.corr(). Used seaborn heatmap plot - possible correlations with num_cfritic, actor3_facebook, gross, num_voted, cast_total,
num_user, actor2_facebook, imdb_score. Question remains on how to do qualitative data? Example cose here: 
http://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/network_correlations.html
- NB had an issue of not seeing plots inside jupyter, this was due to needing comman 'matlib plot inline'
- Saving seaborn plots from within Jupyter - tried various methods of savefig but didn't seem to be working, actually looks like command
was just taking a long time to process so shutdown and re-opened notebook. This worked although output figure isn't great.

Feature Analysis
- Would like to know how to pick features to use in classifier based on correlation matrix. Useful webpage: 
http://blog.datadive.net/selecting-good-features-part-i-univariate-selection/
- Suggests that the df.corr() method (which I think by default uses pearson correlation} is fine but note only shows up linear 
relationships. Might therefore be worth plotting each individual feature anyway. Or perhaps trying one of those big seaborn matrix plots
with labelled data?
- Tried to do sns.pairplot on all of the (labelled) quantitative data. First got an error to do with minimum values and histrograms - it 
seems that the histogram plotting doesn't like empty values so tried putting zeros in all blank cells in excel. Worked! Now have a pair 
plot for all quant data with labelled number of facebook likes (low/medium/high). This is a huge graph! Now need to go through it and 
figure out what it means. Diagnals are just individual features versus facebook likes right? I.e. how does the frequency of high/medium/low
facebook likes spread over the various values of that feature. So that's good for individual checking of feature importance.
- Next steps: what can we gain from that huge pairplot and how can we approach qualitative data (Katja's python script likely to be useful
here)
